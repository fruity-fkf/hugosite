## INTRO
well this is a rant about Gentoo users

---
### WHY

why the fuck do you use gentoo
it's slow as fuck to compile and install software for diminishing performance gains.  
And don't yap about customizability. you don't use most of the "customizability" offered to you. And you don't even need it.  

Also why do y'all have so few packages in your package manager?  
"But ackshualy you can compile from source after downloading the software"   
BITCH FUCK NO. There's no reason to have a package manager at all then. just make it install the kernel and libraries and nothing else.Compile everything else from source after cloning the github repositoy.  
Even grandpa debian has more packages....WAYY more of them. Especially after the new version of it (finally) released  
In fact  
MOVE TO DEBIAN OR SOMETHING DAMMIT  
OR ARCH  
Stop being a brain dead retard who uses gentoo.  
please come  back to the light side..
